## Introduction to R packages

We discuss R packages, how they are going to be the deployment medium for our latex packages, and different ways we can deploy these packages.

### What is an R package

An R package brings together code, data, documentation and tests in a unit of code that is easily shared. R packages can be shared by their source or pre-built binaries. An R package is not a library, but a directory of files which extend R. 

### Why should I build R packages

R packages provide a testable structure to deploy R code, data, and reports for R code. Package development is very mature so building packages is very easy and standardized. Packages allow the developer to list all dependencies necessary to run functions in a namespace that avoids collisions.

## How to build your R package

In the following sections we are going to build our R package.

### usethis

To build out the package structure for us we are going to use the `usethis` R package. The `usethis` package does a lot of the legwork for us, and we provide the description from the package below.


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.cap='usethis description', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/description.png', dpi = NA)
```

To install we run:

```{r}
install.packages("usethis")
```

To create our package structure we will run:

```{r}
usethis::create_package(getwd())
```

The function creates a `DESCRIPTION`, `NAMESPACE`, and `.RBuildignore` files and a directory named `\R`. These are the minimum required components necessary to build and distribute and R package.
